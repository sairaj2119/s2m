# S2Media

S2Media which stands for Simple Social Media is a social media
site which is inspired from the best features of popular applications
like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin

## Why I made S2Media?

As a beginner to web devlopment, I was always facinated by
sites which had a lot of user interaction, like Amazon and Facebook,
but Facebook caught my eye with **real time notifications**

That was the instant I decided to build a simpler version of
these gaigantic social media sites. The **aim** has always been to
**learn** how web technologies work together when there is ton a
of user interaction and to implement as many features possible including **real time notifications**
(this was the main feature I wanted to have)

keys

### Enviornment Variables

#### 1) Client

- Create a file named `.env.local` in `/apps/client` folder
- Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
- Browse to your firebase project settings, by clicking on the
  gear or cog icon in the left sidebar
- In the _general_ setion of project settings, scroll down
  until you find `firebaseConfig` object with some project credentials
- Now fill your `.env.local` with the values from `firebaseConfig` object
  in your firebase project settings
- All enviornment Variables in `client` ðŸ‘‡
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<fill_this>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<fill_this>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<fill_this>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<fill_this>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<fill_this>`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<fill_this>`

#### 2) Server

- Create a file `.env` in `apps/server` folder
